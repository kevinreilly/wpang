Wordpress install wrapped in an Angularjs app.
This is a project I've bee working on in preparation for the REST API to be integrated into Wordpress Core in a later realease. I really love the idea of using Wordpress solely as a content management system and using Angularjs for front-end and routing. There are a lot of Wordpress themes that use Angularjs in their template files, but what I want is to wrap the entire Wordpress install in a Angularjs app.

Utilizes:
- Bootstrap 3
- WP REST API v2 Wordpress Plugin
